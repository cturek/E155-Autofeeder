## Autofeeder Parts

The physical autofeeder consists of four 3D printed parts and a Nema-17 12V stepper motor. The exact motor used is listed in the [resources page](https://cturek.github.io/E155-Autofeeder/resources/).

The base of the autofeeder has a small tray for holding food, a hole to allow the motor through, and six slots for the food container to fit in. The most important part of the autofeeder is the tube which connects the top and the feed tray.

To hold the disc and shield in place, as well as to carry the bulk of food, the container encases the disc and has a small slot to keep the shield in place. It additionally has six tabs which lock into the base, providing a sound assembly.

The fully assembled autofeeder should look something like this:
