# Project Abstract

<i><p>Automatic pet feeders have become an increasingly popular choice for pet owners around the globe. They offer an easy way to keep their pets fed while away, be it at work or on vacation. Autofeeders are also useful for measuring out exact portions, and pets become trained to eat at regular times and not to bother their owner when they're ready for another meal.

This device sports two modes: autofeed mode, where the machine dispenses food at a certain time every day, and RFID mode, where the device waits for an RFID card to be present on the machine before dispensing. Users may freely select between the two and are able to configure the current time, the feed time or delay, and the amount to be dispensed.</p></i>
